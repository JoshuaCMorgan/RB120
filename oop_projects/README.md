# What's Here
Here are larger programs using OO concepts covered in RB120 lessons up to this point.  These projects focus on OO design and architecture at an introductory level.

## The Projects
These projects helped to solidify my object oriented knowledge.  Besides focusing on how Ruby implements object oriented programming, the projects also gave me an introduction to knowledge of design patterns, architectural tradeoffs, and some best practices.
