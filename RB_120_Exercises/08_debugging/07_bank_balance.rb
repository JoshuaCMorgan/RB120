We created a simple BankAccount class with overdraft protection, that does not allow a withdrawal greater than the amount of the current balance. We wrote some example code to test our program. However, we are surprised by what we see when we test its behavior. Why are we seeing this unexpected output? Make changes to the code so that we see the appropriate behavior.

class BankAccount
  attr_reader :balance

  def initialize(account_number, client)
    @account_number = account_number
    @client = client
    @balance = 0
  end

  def deposit(amount)
    if amount > 0
      self.balance += amount
      "$#{amount} deposited. Total balance is $#{balance}."
    else
      "Invalid. Enter a positive amount."
    end
  end

  def withdraw(amount)
    if amount > 0
      success = (self.balance -= amount)
    else
      success = false
    end

    if success
      "$#{amount} withdrawn. Total balance is $#{balance}."
    else
      "Invalid. Enter positive amount less than or equal to current balance ($#{balance})."
    end
  end

  def balance=(new_balance)
    if valid_transaction?(new_balance)
      @balance = new_balance
      true
    else
      false
    end
  end

  def valid_transaction?(new_balance)
    new_balance >= 0
  end
end

# Example

account = BankAccount.new('5538898', 'Genevieve')

                          # Expected output:
p account.balance         # => 0
p account.deposit(50)     # => $50 deposited. Total balance is $50.
p account.balance         # => 50
p account.withdraw(80)    # => Invalid. Enter positive amount less than or equal to current balance ($50).
p account.balance         # => 50

=end

# setter method returns argument.  So you need to figure a way to bring the 
# valid_transaction? method it and use its return value.
# and you probably want to protect your balance so folks don't change it.
